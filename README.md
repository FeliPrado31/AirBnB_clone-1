# Holberton BnB (AirBnB clone) - The console

# Introduction

This is part one of the AirBnB clone project which consists in creating a webpage (front-end and back-end) similar to the AirBnB one. On this case, we're focusing on **making the console** used to Create, Read, Update and Delete objects that will go on our webpage.
